# ENERGETICS
# Energy in:
#   Foraging time based on temperature limits for activity, but unlikely limiting
# Assimilation rate [likely limiting?]: can roughly estimate based on current assimilation rate data; Julia improving by weighing wheat grass consumption; and defectation?
#   
#   Energy use:
#   Metabolic rate, accounting for elevation due to activity?
# temperature dependence of MR (ml CO2/hr): https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12083
# converted into lipid consumed based on a 2L O2 consumed for every 1g of lipid consumed
#assume respiratory quotient of 0.7 for lipids update
#converted to energy use assuming 39 kJ g^âˆ’1 lipid

#   Assume portion of energy allocated to maintenance, reproduction
# [Needs: estimation approach; based on lipid content?
#     

# FECUNDITY: 
#   Estimate energy available for reproduction then use an energetic estimate of reproduction to estimate fecundity
# [Needs: energetic cost of reproduction
#   Options: bomb calorimetry of eggs; mass (Levy and Nufio paper) and composition of eggs [preferred?]
#   Infer from eggpods laid in field, but seems better to use data to validate estimates]

# SURVIVAL: Use thermal tolerance and stress response data to estimate daily survival. We will model survival as the product of survival to adulthood and daily survival. 

# FITNESS: We will multiply these additive (fecundity) and multiplicative (survival) components to estimate fitness and the fitness estimates will provide estimates of selection on phenotypes / genotypes. The model could potentially be extended to include a quantitative genetic model of evolution
